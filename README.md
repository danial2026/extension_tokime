# Tokime - Privacy-Focused Time Tracker

A browser extension for time tracking with simple stopwatches. All data stays on your device - no servers, no tracking.

## Features

- **100% Private**: All data stored locally on your device only
- Create multiple stopwatches to track time for different tasks
- Start and stop time tracking with a single click
- View detailed session history for each stopwatch
- Export/import your data for backup and transfer

## Privacy First

Tokime is designed with privacy as the top priority:

- **No servers**: Your data never leaves your browser
- **No analytics**: We don't track your usage or collect any metrics
- **No third-party services**: Completely self-contained
- **No permissions**: Only requires storage permission to save your timers

## How It Works

1. Create a new stopwatch with a title
2. Start tracking time with a click
3. Stop the stopwatch when you're done
4. View your total time and session history
